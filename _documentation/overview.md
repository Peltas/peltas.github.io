  Peltas is a "No ETL" tool for Alfresco. It is based on robust and known frameworks such as Spring Boot, Spring Batch and Spring Integrations. We offer an innovative way of processing Alfresco Audit entries and Alfresco live nodes, in order to write them to a database, a flat file, eleastic search, a custom REST API or any other target.
  
  Peltas is made to work with the out of the box Alfresco audit (alfresco-access) application and is easily configurable to work with any custom Alfresco audit applications if required.
  
  With us you can easily and rapidly gain insights in your Alfresco data.
  
  Alfresco (Audit or Live workspace) data sources are configured with the same configuration. However, only one source can be processed at once. This means that one source can be accessed with one Peltas instance and that you would need to run several Peltas instances in order to access two or more different sources. For its safe execution, Peltas needs a database and therfore it requires a JDBC connection.
