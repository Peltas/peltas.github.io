This guide walks you through the process of creating a Peltas configuration.


== What is Peltas?

Peltas is a so called ELT (No ETL) tool for Alfresco. It is based on Spring Boot, Spring Batch and Spring Integrations and offers an innovative way of processing Alfresco Audit entries and Alfresco live nodes, in order
to write them to a database, a flat file, eleastic search, a custom REST API or any other target.
